        "R.J. moved to Oahu in 2003 to pursue graduate studies in History at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Seeing an obvious need for sustainable and affordable housing he decided to create a community of energy efficient and affordable homes which became Green Homes at Lualualei, a 25 home State certified affordable community. The 15 affordable homes went to local residents and the low prices combined with the zero down loans allowed the families to own homes for the cost of rent. Since then he developed Green Homes Hanalei st, a 7 home community in Makaha that features solar power and battery storage in addition to countless other energy saving features. When not working, R.J. enjoys all ocean activities and he practices yoga daily.",
